# Energy-consumption-predictor
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to predict energy consumption and detect anomalies in usage patterns using a simulated dataset. Instead of real-time IoT sensors, the dataset is synthetically generated to reflect real-world energy usage trends influenced by factors like temperature, humidity, and time.
